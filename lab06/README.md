# Control flow (while)

## initials
Write a program that reads first and last name from the standard input and writes the initials in upper case (even if input is in lower case) to the standard output. Also, the program should work reliably and exit with a non-zero exit code and a message if it encounters a problem.

## min
Write a program that reads integers until it reaches the end of the standard input stream. The program should find the smallest number and write it to the standard output. Also, the program should work reliably and exit with a non-zero exit code and a message if it encounters a problem (e.g. a letter instead of a digit).
